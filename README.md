# KenzieCapstone Project

This project was completed along with four other group members to showcase our knowledge from our year-long certificate program. My contributions were focused on the backend, particularly with data models, service methods, cache system, and unit and integration tests.

### Dietary Restriction Recipe Service
People with food allergies or other dietary restrictions can find it difficult to know what to make for dinner. Our service will allow you to submit or browse recipes where all the dietary restriction information is easily accessible. You can filter by one or more dietary restrictions to find a recipe that meets your needs.

### Key user stories:

1. I am a caretaker for my grandmother, and I want to find recipes she can eat that are dairy-free.
2. I created a great recipe for gluten free muffins, and I would like to add it to the website for other people to try.
3. I have several family members with different allergies (gluten free, dairy free, egg free) and I want to know what I can make for dinner for all three.
4. I tried a recipe from this website and would like to leave a rating for that recipe.
5. I need to make dinner but I donâ€™t have the energy to scroll recipes that fit my dietary needs, so I would like to get a random recipe that is vegetarian.


### Project Specifications:
